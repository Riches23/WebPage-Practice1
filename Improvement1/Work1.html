    Life is just a Puzzle... The more you think about it, the more it's incomprehensible. Most times, I wake up and wonder, how life can be this twisted. It's like we are always going through the same routine every solid day. A trader trades in the market for as long as she/he can imagine or go get a job. We all were once college students but now, we gat to think of better things to be better in the society. If i may ask, <mark id="NaYou"> What is the purpose of Life?</mark> We were born, natured and all grown up now... We gat our hands on any passionate or ok stuffs we could possibly come across.. For what, if I may ask? All for the purpose of feeling we ain't just existing but we are part of life... It's a baby girl, Glory to God... Celebration everywhere... Yeahhhhhhhhh! Congratulations to Mr and Mrs Etim. They just had a new seed. Growing up to realise that, I was being taken care of. It's definitely going to be me taking care of them too and others as life has its way. Really? For One's sake, Really? Was this also part of my duty to humanity of why i was brought into this world?

    Have you ever thought about getting rich and all you could ever try doing was to always make money from every little job you applied for and called in. You realise one thing. The higher u earn, the higher your zeal to earn more or possibly make your own money by being your boss. You are never satisfied... Now, i guess i'm becoming selfish...and why ain't I feeling any guilt? Why is it that, each time i get what i long for, i never stopped craving for more? Why are humans like this? Is this how we were made or we just on our own, chose this path? That takes me back to my very first question, What is the purpose of Life? I just can't stop wrapping my mind round it.
