        You can't tell me you are made perfectly well until you have exhibited some traits... Why? Simply because, He said; He that is in us, is greater than he that is in the world. If you know and i repeat that, If you KNOW that you are special, why think otherwise especially when you are momentarily swept by a storm? Storm can be anything. Storm is any opposition towards your goals or achievements. It's always said, the higher we mount, the higher the storm in our way... Meaning, it can't be avoided for as long as you aim higher. I must tell you today, be you a Muslim, Christain, Idol worshipper; you will always come across storms. It doesn't mean the end... It tells you one thing, you are about breaking through or should I say, you are about achieving something very big... You are capable.. It's in your DNA. <i><b> You are all you need</b></i> to make your dreams come through... The only one stopping you; Guess who? It's only YOU. so, go out there, change your thought... even when it seems impossible... It's just a phase that will definitely pass. Hence, the endpoint of that phase is left to you to decide.
